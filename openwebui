## Open Web UI
- Open Web UI is a self-hosted AI interface that empowers you to interact with local AI models or external APIs. It provides a user-friendly dashboard to manage and deploy AI models locally using tools like [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), enabling self-hosted model serving without relying on the cloud. Additionally, Open Web UI supports integration with hosted models through APIs (e.g., OpenAI) by utilizing API keys for seamless external access.

### Environment
- If you have followed the instructions provided in the readme, you should have spun a container with OpenWebUI
- We also downloaded opensource models, like deepseek and llama
- OpenWebUI has capabilities to connect to hosted models
- Login to your openai account and create an API key
- Go here: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys
- Add API key from openai to OpenWebUI admin panel, specifically for openai
- Once you have openai API keys added, you will see additional models from openai
- Be careful using hosted models as they cost money. Some will cost between $100 to $500 a month
